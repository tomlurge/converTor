* **BEWARE** of ConvertOrAdresses
* first replace convertor/trans in schema dir
* then regenerate all schemata
* on src rightclick refactor rename
* in build.xml aplle-R convertor -> trans
* in project drawer right click on top level entry -> rename project
* replace in todo.md
* replace in readme.nd
* find/replace from root dir still finds a lot more
* just checking: find transAdresses

* do something to see what happens (experimenting with branches)
