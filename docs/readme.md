Structural overview
===================

`Base` is the class that contains the main method.

`Main` initializes a new `Base` *base*, which in turn initializes `Args` and 
`Writers` singletons.
`Args` contains default arguments like input directory, output format etc and
evaluates command line arguments.
`Writers` stores fileWriters per descriptor type and month. It initializes new
fileWriters on demand, according to incoming descriptor types, their date and 
the configured format.

`Main` then starts the method `runConversion()` on the *base* just created
which iterates over the incoming descriptors, converts them according to 
type, gets the appropriate fileWriter from `Writers and appends the converted 
descriptors to these fileWriters.

Actual converters (`ConvertRelay`, `ConvertBridge` etc) are all subclasses of the
abstract Class `Convert`. Actual Writers (`WriteAvro`, `WriteParquet` and 
`WriteJson`) are all implementations of the interface `Write`. Actual descriptor
types, their properties and methods are all defined as enums in `Types`.

Encoding of the converted descriptors is managed in the `Write` classes and 
relies on the encoder schemata and autogenerated Avro classes in the package 
`encoders`.

After all descriptors are converted `closeAllWriters()` is called to perform 
some housekeeping, making sure that all writers write to disk before the program
exits.
